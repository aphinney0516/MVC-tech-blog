### Description
The intention of this project was to create a blog that can store user information via a sign in and display past user articles and provide a place for users to add new blogs. The purpose of this project is to provide a place for individuals in the tech industry to store and share thier thoughts. Through this project I continue to struggle with creating routes and connecting the front end with the back end in general.
